Portfolio Website | amineamor.ca
This project involved building a responsive and visually engaging portfolio website for a freelance photographer client, showcasing their work. Developed using React and Tailwind CSS, the site is designed for fast loading and cross-device compatibility. Firebase was integrated as the backend, handling image storage, authentication, and database management. The Firebase Storage service was used to securely store and serve high-quality images, while Firestore provided a reliable and scalable database for managing portfolio content. Additionally, Firebase Authentication was set up to ensure secure access for admin updates. Framer Motion was incorporated to add smooth animations, enhancing user engagement and interactivity throughout the site.
